# Modern Workplace Meeting 18. Novemnber 2019

## Look back
<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
- Delivery of seven SIEATs between April and November 2019
- Following legacy (Spanish) presentation layout with Austrian salt
- Marvellous customer feedbacks "Vielen Dank!!", "Vielen Dank nochmal für den tollen Showcase und die ausführliche Präsentation zum Thema Information Security im Microsoft Umfeld.", "... den Nutzen dieser Lösungen möglichst rasch umsetzen", even with LinkedIn [posts](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6586193734059335680-Kvfg)
</div>

## Learnings
<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
- Two presentation facilitators important (for the roleplay)
- "Introduction story" too time consuming - not enough time for demos
- To much E-Mail ping-pong - not enough Teams Usage
- Not enough E5 workloads in the demos
- Very different knowhow levels of customers
</div>


## How we planned a refurbish

## SIEAT.net Refurbish
<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
- currently 12 updated "scenarios"
- more E5 workloads
- low E-mail, high Teams usage
- better documentation & follow-up (https://docs.sieat.net)
- better flexibility
- better update-ability
- some ToDos left (to be done in January): even more scenarios, enhanced documentation, better storytelling, modernizing look & feel
</div>


## ASKs
<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
- We need to plan H2 engagements now by starting to identify the right customers
- To maximize the "experience" time, we need briefed customers on M365 security platform
- We need scoping calls with customers upfront to be able to best-tailor the experience
</div>

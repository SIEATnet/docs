## Android Enterprise
Maria uses a fully managed Android Enterprise tablet. All necessary apps were pushed to this device automatically. Her corporate identity was automatically deployed to the device while enrollment, so no further need to sign-in required.

## Outlook Mobile
Maria can use Outlook Mobile the same way as she does on the PC. Even the latest mail from Josef including sensitivity labeling and encryption is displayed correctly.
